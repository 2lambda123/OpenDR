# OpenDR

A mod for the [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) strategy game engine that aims to recreate the original Auran RTS classic. Created using the [OpenRAModSDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK).

Please note this mod is a work-in-progress. Many features are missing or incomplete at this stage.

You can get the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/drogoganor/OpenDR/releases). If you have trouble installing or would like to compile from source, please see the [Installation page](https://github.com/drogoganor/OpenDR/wiki/Installation).

This mod installs content from the freely-available DR demo.

Join us on the [OpenDR discord](https://discord.gg/3MKcGSW) if you want to talk about the mod.

## A note on running the mod in Visual Studio

You will need to switch to OpenRA.Launcher and set the command line arguments to: `Engine.EngineDir=".." Engine.ModSearchPaths="..\\..\\mods" Game.Mod=dr`

When running OpenRA.Utility, set the environment variables to the following:

| Name             | Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| ENGINE_DIR       | ..            |
| MOD_SEARCH_PATHS | ..\\..\\mods  |
