# Dark Reign mod for OpenRA

A Dark Reign mod for the [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) strategy game engine. Created using the [OpenRAModSDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK).

This mod is a WIP made available for testing purposes. Many [features](https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign/wiki/Dark-Reign-features) are missing or incomplete and the game might crash.

This mod uses assets from the freely available Dark Reign demo, or alternatively you can install assets from an original game disc.

See the [Installation](https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign/wiki/Installation) page if you want to install it, or the [wiki](https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign/wiki) for other information about the mod and OpenRA.
