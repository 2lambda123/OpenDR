# Dark Reign mod for OpenRA

A Dark Reign mod for the [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) strategy game engine. Created using the [OpenRAModSDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK).

This mod is a WIP made available for testing purposes. Many [features](https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign/wiki/Dark-Reign-features) are missing or incomplete and the game might crash. Most notably, the Skirmish AI is broken in the most recent build and will not build anything. Only multiplayer and a couple of custom campaign maps are available.

This mod uses game content from the freely available Dark Reign demo, or alternatively you can install the content from an original game disc.
